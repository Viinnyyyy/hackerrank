Pseudocode for Roman Numerals
=============================

What I have to do is to get the order of Roman numerals.


Does regex have the format already?
Saves me a lot of time in handling the stress associated with programming functions that fix this shit

It seems regex easily has this things on hand. At least ----> No be at least o.


This nigga is making me so happyyyyyy. 

M --> 1000
D --> 500
C --> 100
L --> 50
X --> 10
V --> 5
I --> 1

The range is within 4000
So the maximum M can be is 4
D and C can be rearranged as:
C
CC
CCC
CD
D
DC
DCC
DCCC

same with L and X
And V and I
After M: between 100 and 900 can be accounted for
C can be within {0,3}
CD once
D1C{0,3}
CM

After C: between 10 and 90 can be accounted for
X can be within {0,3}
XL once
L1X{0,3}
XC

After X: between 1 and 9 can be accounted for
I can be within {0,3}
IV once
V1I{0,3}
IX

^M(CM|CD|D?C{0,3})(XC|XL|L?X{0,3})(IX|IV|V?{0,3})$

This is not complete:
Any numeral could be--->
    MMMM
    D
    CCC
    L
    XXX
    V
    III
