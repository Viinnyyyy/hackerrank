MY HACKERRANK PROJECT
=====================

This repo is made up of two files per problem:
1. The .py file which contains the python script.
2. The .pseudocode file gives the thinking and rationale as I run through the problemset.

While the .pseudocode file does not include all nuances of my thoughts, I believe it gives beyond reasonable doubt the intentions of
my coding.
This will be updated frequently
